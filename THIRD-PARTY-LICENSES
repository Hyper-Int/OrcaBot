PRE-INSTALLED AI CODING AGENTS (installed in sandbox Docker image)
================================================================================

Note: These tools are installed from public package registries at Docker build
time. Users must supply their own API keys to use the underlying LLM services.
API/model access is governed by each provider's separate Terms of Service.

Claude Code (@anthropic-ai/claude-code) is NOT pre-installed. The npm cache is
pre-warmed for faster user-initiated installation, but the package itself is
uninstalled during the build. Users install it on-demand and accept Anthropic's
Terms of Service at that time.
