FIX SANDBOX PERFORMANCE ISSUE

small bugs
  when changing light mode terminals screens clear
  codex missing icon
  session not found on workspace after closing terminals

CAN WE OPEN A BROWSER INSIDE TERMINAL?

DREAM GOALS
* Can someone use OrcaBot to set up Gas Town? Ralph? BMAD?
* Is this Turing complete? Can someone create OrcaBot in OrcaBot?

work out what
https://orcabot-controlplane.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
8  * - CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN: Your team domain (e.g., "myteam" for myteam.cloudflareaccess.com) 
9  * - CF_ACCESS_AUD: The Application Audience (AUD) tag from CF Access dashboard    

  These come from your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard:                                                                          
                                                                                                                                 
  CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN:                                                                                                         
  - When you set up Cloudflare Zero Trust, you pick a team name
  - If your login URL is https://mycompany.cloudflareaccess.com, then CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN = "mycompany"
  - It's whatever you chose, not a UUID
                                                                                                                                 
  CF_ACCESS_AUD:                                                                                                                 
  - This is the "Application Audience (AUD) Tag"
  - Found in: Zero Trust → Access → Applications → [Your App] → Overview
  - It's a long hex string like a1b2c3d4e5f6... (not a UUID format, but similar purpose)
  - Uniquely identifies your Access application   

theres lots of secret tokens in the repo
is it a problem if the repo is private?
should we add some watermarks?

  Next Steps                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                 
  1. Set up Cloudflare Access - Follow DEPLOYMENT.md Step 1
  2. Deploy control plane with production config - Step 2
  3. Deploy frontend to Cloudflare Pages - Step 4
  4. Remove dev login from frontend UI (the "Dev mode login" button)
